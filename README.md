The below questions should be answered regarding your assignment submission!

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
I only asked my TA, Chris, for some help in our section. 


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
It took me about 5-6 hours to complete this homework. 


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
There were some issues with list items in dataframes that were challenging so I'd say a 8/10


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
I'd say that a warning should be in place to unlist some dataframe columns before being able to use dplyr fully
